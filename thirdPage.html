 <h2>Starting Out<h2>
 <article class="">
 <h3>Young Baller<h3>
 <p>I was 3 when I started to play soccer. I immediately fell in love with it and knew I was going to play for a long time. I played to Gahanna Soccer Assoc. which is a rec. leauge. I played with them until 5th grade when I decided to tryout for a select club soccer team to take my game to the next level.</p>

 <h3>Club Soccer<h3>
<p>Like I said before I started playing club in 5th garde. The name of my first club was Central Ohio Elite. It was a smaller club but a good start. I learned a lot of technical skills and ways to improve my game. I played with this club for 2 years until 7th grade when I moved to a club called Sporting Padula Soccer Academy. This club was much larger, more expensive, required way more commitment, and a way harder team to make. I did make the top team for my age division and I could not have been happier. I am still with this club today and it is my third year.</p>
