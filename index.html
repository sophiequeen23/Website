     <h3>Interests As A Child</h3>
     <p>When I was younger I started to dance when I was 3. I really loved it and I did it up until 5th grade. I stopped doing it because I wanted to dedicate more of my time to soccer and start to play at more of a competitive level. Also when I was younger I played basketball. My first season was when I was in 4th garde. I played for the school in 7th grade and that was my last year of basketball. I stopped playing because I lost my passion for it and wanted to be fully committed to soccer. As a kid I was so weird and lowkey insane. I would throw temper tantrums like every day and I would break things all the time. I think it was because my parents got divorced and it mad me really sad and mad but thats besides the point.</p>

       <p>I currently don't have any pets but when I was younger and my brother still lived at home we used to have a pet lizard but it died because it lived in my brothers room when he was like 10 and he never took care of it.</p>
